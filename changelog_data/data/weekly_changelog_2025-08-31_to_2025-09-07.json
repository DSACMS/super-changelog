Since Argyle and\nPinwheel both add `<style>` tags to the page, we need some way to ensure\nthose are allowed.\n\nPreviously, we just made sure the page was served without a CSP header.\nThis was brittle (we had to remember to disable turbo navigation on any\nlink that led to /employer_search so that the page would actually be\nre-requested without the header) and less secure than just properly\nallowing these `<style>` tags through the CSP.\n\nThe most straightforward way is to just pin the hash of the `<style>`\ntag contents. This commit, primarily, does that. (This will break\nwhenever we update the Pinwheel/Argyle SDKs, but I've provided\ninstructions on how to get the new hashes at that time.) I also had to\nadd Argyle's domain to the script-src and connect-src.\n\nSince that allows for re-enabling of Turbo, this commit also does that,\nresulting in a much faster and smooth experience going between these\npages.",
